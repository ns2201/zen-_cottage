          <p>
            <b>ZEN Cottages</b> were founded by architect Andrew Shimmer and his
            wife Carol. They wanted to create classically-designed,
            efficient, and prefabricated structures that could be easily
            moved, contracted, expanded, and sold while maintaining both
            integrity and aesthetics.
          </p> <br>
          <p>The company respects the natural environment and deeply cares
            about it. Therefore, we do our best to use building
            constructions and delivery systems that are flexible and have
            minimal impact on the land they occupy.
